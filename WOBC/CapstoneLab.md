# Capstone Simulations

## 1. Aphach defacement

* Attack Type
  - A phishing attack
  - Opportunistic attack
  - Credentials are stolen
  - Brute Force the SSH service
* Lateral Movement
  - Lateral Movement vs Pivoting
* Script
  - Bash/sh
* Persistence
  - Cronjob
* Data Exfiltration
  - User account information
* Goal
  - Detect cron jobs injected by the attacker

## 2. Aphach financial defacement

* Goal
  - Detect to find the defacement
  - Detect a successful root login = SSH connection
  - Detect cron jobs injected by the attacker
  - Detect data exfiltration = Decoding file
  - Detect exploitation through SQLi
  - Detect Database destruction through SQLi
  - Delete scheduled cron jobs
  - Remediate the vulnerability and mitigate the attack
