# CySA Study Note


1. System and network architectures

* In this course, we will review the basics of system architecture, which focuses on software and systems, and network architecture, which includes the design and structure of a computer network.

2. Threat intelligence in support of organizational security

* This course explains how threat intelligence contributes to organizational security. It covers the use of attack frameworks, threat research, and threat modeling.

3. Attack methodology frameworks

* In this course, you will learn about tools and frameworks, such as MITRE ATT&CK, that help visualize and understand how attackers carry out cyberattacks.

4. Analyzing potentially malicious activity

* In this course, we discuss symptoms that may indicate that potentially malicious activity is occuring, some of the tools that detect such activities, as well as pattern recognition and social engineering.

5. Techniques for malicious activity analysis

* This course will dive into some techniques cybersecurity analysts use to find potential malicious activities and analyze files, emails and behaviors to determine which activities are real threats.

6. Tools for malicious activity analysis

* This course provides a series of hands-on demonstrations of some of the tools a cybersecurity analyst can use to analyze potentially malicious activities and determine their threat levels.

7. Fundamentals of threat intelligence

* In this course covering the fundamentals of threat intelligence, you will learn about threat actors, automated monitoring, supply chain vulnerabilities, and how collection tools can find network vulnerabilities.

8. Applying threat intelligence in support of organizational security

* You can’t mount a good defense without understanding the threats that exist, so in this course we dive in risk and vulnerability management, threat modeling and threat hunting, and much more.

9. Vulnerability scanning methods and concepts

* Explore concepts in vulnerability scanning and identification from asset discovery to industry frameworks to critical infrastructure, with valuable details about software vulnerabilities.

10. Vulnerability assessment tools
Course · 1 hour, 23 minutes

Learn what tools can assist with assessing vulnerabilities, with hands-on demonstrations that provide examples of various scenarios and how to handle them.

11. Analyzing and prioritizing vulnerabilities

* Once you know you have a vulnerability, what should you do next? In this course, you will learn how to validate vulnerabilities and how to prioritize them within the context of your organizational environment.

12. Mitigating vulnerabilities

* Once you know you have a vulnerability and have determined its priority, how to you mitigate it? In this course, we discuss various types of attacks, including injection and overflow attacks, and how to mitigate their effects.

13. Vulnerability handling and response

* This in-depth course covers a lot of ground regarding how to respond to vulnerabilities. The list of topics includes controls and control functions, patch and risk management, attack surfaces, action plans and KPIs, and much more.

14. Incident response procedures

* How do you respond when there has been an incident? In this course, we will cover the most important aspects of preparation, containment, eradication and recovery.

15. Post-incident response activities

* When an incident occurs, there are steps that need to be taken, including learning from the event, creating a report and communicating about the event, all of which we discuss in this course.

16. Utilize basic digital forensics techniques

* In this course, you will learn how to use digital forensics after an incident occurs to maintain regulatory and legal compliance.
