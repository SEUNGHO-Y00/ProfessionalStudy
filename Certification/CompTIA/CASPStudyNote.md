  - California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
  - General Data Protection Law (LGPD) = Brazil
  - Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Act (COPPA)
* Awareness of cross-jurisdictional compliance requirements
  - e-discovery = electronically stored information (ESI)
  - Legal holds = preserve all relevant information before
  - Due diligence = Before
  - Due care = After
  - Export controls = to foreign countries or entities
  - Contractual obligations = the specific requirements and responsibilities
